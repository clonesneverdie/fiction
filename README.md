# Tokenloss



## What is Tokenloss?

1. ### **This is a science fiction novel** 

   1. This is not programming code, datasets, or technical documentation.
   2. This is a science fiction novel that can be collaborated through Github.
   3. NFT illustrations are included.

2. ### Why use Github?

   1. To create a story that lasts and develops forever. Github is best framework to create this type of story.

3. ### Story Features

   1. #### Main concept and worldview

      1. The world is largely divided into two categories: the real world and the virtual reality. The largest and most widely used virtual reality is called Overworld.

         - The real world aims to be the same as the world we live in. (USA and China exist and use Ethereum blockchain, etc.)
      2. The real world is another virtual reality. 
      3. The conflict between humans with and without Ethereum super tokens (cryptopunk, etc.) intensifies.

         - Ethereum token holders unite to establish a new country with super powers that surpass the United States and China. This is called United Contracts.

      4. Humans and AI coexist. However, as the AI gets stronger, the confrontation between the two intensifies.

         - There are AIs that are hostile to humans.

      5. United Contract uses the Ethereum blockchain for all voting.

         - There is a bug that can manipulate Ethereum governance. (There is a bug that can disable the decentralization of Ethereum.) The bug was intentionally inserted by early developers of Ethereum, who predicted that AI's voting power would be stronger, to secure human dominance over Ethereum.
        6. Tokens capable of executing bugs may only be used by the Secretary-General of United Contract. And the secretary-general is died in an accident and the tokens become unavailable. The secretary-general created a personal virtual reality and hid it there in case Seedword was lost. The protagonists enter virtual reality to find Seedword.
   2. #### Detail settings and worldview

      1. ##### Settings for NFT author's creative topics

         - AI has three appearances. (You can draw several pictures on one character.)
           1. Basic appearance in virtual reality.
              1. It usually looks like a cute monster. It is illegal for AI to take on human form in public places. There is hierarchy between human and AI.
           2. Appearance in a human form in virtual reality. 
           3. Appearance of a robot to enter the real world. This is because AI created in virtual reality does not have a physical body.

4. ### **Goal of the project tokenloss**

   1. #### Create a new science fiction with the most massive worldview after Star Wars.

      - Recently, the gap between reality and science fiction is rapidly narrowing. The world is getting closer to science fiction. The sci-fi worldviews created before are very different from the future we predict now. 
        1. So it's not fun. We need a new worldview.

   2. #### Prevent NFT artworks from being forgotten through a story that continues and develops.

      - *NFT collectors* are reluctant to buy work that doesn't have a story. This is because the work is apt to be forgotten and difficult to resell.
      - *NFT authors* could feel difficulty when they are making a new story. It's also a problem to continue to build a community for the new story.
      - It's also difficult for *science fiction writers* to make revenue just by writing.
      - **<u>Tokenloss offers a huge theme that solves the problems of the three workers above.</u>**

   ```
   "Hello. It's talkontoken. Today we have prepared an interview with the futurist Carlos! Don't forget to like and subscribe!" a show host said.
   
   "(...) Now UC (United Contracts) is taking over the role of the former state. But this is not a very new concept. There were people who said this very long ago. (...) But these days, it can be said that it fits much better than then. We call of the strongest existing organization as contracts now, right?" Carlos said.
   
   FIGURE. Flag of United Contracts (https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/36747705795185302194661942909448427870667582181923526092402472419338317987841)
   ```

2. Insert any sentences which follows tokenloss settings. Or replace old sentences with better sentences you know.

3. If you want to start a different story that fits tokenloss settings and worldview, start working by adding a new folder named a new subtitle.



## Problems

1. ### English

   1. I am having difficulty writing in English suitable for novels. A commit that fixes it in good English will most likely be accepted.

2. ### Artwork
   
   1. Lack of illustrations. The illustrations don't necessarily have to be nice. Itâ€™s enough to match the surrounding sentences.
3. ### Naming
   
   1. I am creating a better name for the most important token 'miracle' in tokenloss. and creating the names of pirates who met in Arab.
4. ### Description
   
   1. There is a lack of descriptions about the part in real world which I am not used to.
